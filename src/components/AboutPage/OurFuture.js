              Our company is on a mission to create stronger connections and
              reach into the Canadian education consultancy industry. We want
              more people knowing about our services, how we can help them
              achieve their goals with ease of mind so they wonâ€™t have any
              worries or concerns going forward! Our goal is to extend our
              services, not just in LOA assistance and educational guidance. As
              a company we want all aspects of immigration consultation
              including permanent residency, work permit applications etc., by
              obtaining the necessary license which will allow us do become
              Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants! We plan on having a
              headquarter in our home country and want to offer all-inclusive
              services for international students. We can provide them from
              obtaining their LOA, study visa application as well as airport
              pick ups/rentals up until applying for permanent residency or even
              citizenship.
